# What is this?

This is a template for getting started with the Serenity Jasmine runner.

### Want to use it?

There a few ways to do this. I have a local clone of FubuMVC and I keep its src/Fubu/bin/Debug in my PATH. Regardless of how you get it into your path, here is the command you want:

> fubu new MyProject -g git://github.com/jmarnold/jasminetemplate.git

### Do I have to remember the url?

If you prefer, you can create an alias file right alongside your fubu.exe named ".fubunew-alias". Here is an example: https://gist.github.com/1489386
